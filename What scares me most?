What scares me most?
I'm nervous about pairing sessions. I am pretty slow at typing, although I am improving. I'm nervous about making my partner frustrated. I'm concerned about communicating my ideas well and compassionatley. I'm concerned about how effective pairing will be with two beginners.
I'm learning to be beginner. I'm learning how I learn. I am hoping that I will develope strategies for dealing with the fustration and fear. I sometimes fell bad when I can't figure out the answer, I start to feel stupid and then become overwhlmed. I'd like to have more onfidence and aptience with myself. Why am I puting myself down for not knowing the answer before I have learned it?
