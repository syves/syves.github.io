				<h2>My Biggest Problems</h2>
				<li><p>Getting overwhelmed by how much I need to do</p></li>
				<li><p>Feeling I must be perfect: --->
					I put too much pressure on myself 
					--->which creates stress: 
					--->when I am stressed
					 I think less effectively 
					 and my body tenses up and I get tired more easily</p></li>
				<li><p>I choose to feel bad:
					I KNOW I will be unhappy because I have so much to do or I didn't sleep well ---> therefore I am unhappy</p></li>
				<li><p>Negative outlook</p></li>
				<li><p>Doing things and tasks to validate myself instead of doing them to learn, grow and because I Choose to. I then carry a huge burden of never being good enough and having to complete all my tasks in order to assert my value.</p></li>
				<li><p>I feel like breaks and self care are slacking off, I don't deserve rest or sleep!</p></li>
				<li><p>I hate simply listening and not thinking ahead and analyzing while listening to others talk. Perhaps my need to be heard is making me anxious?</p></li>
				<li><p>I have a hard time paying attention to technical auditory tutorials, I get bored, and start thinking ahead or about what I think about what is being said, then I miss things.</p></li>
				<li><p>I can't stand reading very technical blogs and directions! I get so bored and KNOW I will have a hard time remembering the task until I do it myself.</p></li>

			<h1 id="topic">What is my thinking style?</h1> 
			<h2>Abstract Random Thinkers</h2>
			<h3>I just wanna be free!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>... organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments?!</p></li>
				<li><p>I am challenged by the above description.I do enjoy working with people when I feel I can communicate effectively and my voice is heard.
				I enjoy bringing order to the chaos with leadership and creative thinking. I love to analyze and find myself slipping away into the past and future.</p></li>
				<li><p>I am working now on being more present, to deeply listen first to my body, my feelings and to others. I am excited by the potential support of DBC in this area of growth.</p></li>

				<h2>Stretching my ways of thinking...</h2>
				<li><p>I practice mindfulness</p></li>
				<li><p>I do positive self talk</p></li>
				<li><p>I do positive visualization</p></li>
				<li><p>I organize my time into 25 minute focused work sessions</p></li>
				<li><p>I record my accomplishments on paper</p></li>
				<li><p>I give my self a inner high five!</p></li>
			</ul>	
			<h2>My Learning style</h2>
			<h2>BANG! Kinesthetic POW!</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>I take action!</h3>
				<li><p>I love to learn by doing</li>
				<li><p>I write things down after I read them.</p></li>
				<li><p>I do all the tutorials.</p></li>
				<li><p>I consider the fixed belief that I can't change the way I learn!</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>More Stretching my ways of being</h2>
			<ul>
			<h3>Improving retention Reading technical blogs</h3>
				<li><p>Take notes</p></li>
				<li><p>Summarize</p></li>
				<li><p>Explain to others</p></li>
				<li><p>Draw pictures to illustrate idea</p></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			<h3>Improving Listening</h3>
			<li><p>Repeat in my head each word the speaker says</p></li>
			<li><p>Take notes on what they say</p></li>
			<li><p>Concentrate on the sound of their voice, the construction of the sentence, the time it takes them to say it, and body language</p></li>
			<li><p>I will attempt to not analyze or prepare a response</p></li>
			<li><p>I will not interrupt, I will show that I care about what they are saying, and about them by waiting for them to complete their thought even if we are in a rush and I think Know what they are saying.</p></li>
