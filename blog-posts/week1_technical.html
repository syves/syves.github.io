			<h2>Audible</h2>
				<p>My eye is first drawn to the large centered book deal of the moment.
				The website has two rows of header where I can get listener options, 
				all the stuff I want to use regularly like a wish list.
				 This site helps me to choose a book to read with recommendations
				 based on  my preferences and reading history.
				The look of the sight is cute, neat, organized, simple and minimal. 
				The content is practical, ordered, reduced, flexible and informative.
				 It is easy to navigate from the homepage. 
				I love that is page makes finding a book, which is a daunting task so easy, 
				by offering visual galleries of book options by genre and by referencing my read list. 
				I can also search for a specific book in the header, or browse by genre in the footer
				 if I end up at the bottom and prefer the list format.
				 I feel excited and relaxed at the same time after spending time on this site.
				 It has a cutesy old fashioned feel, with bookmarks and banners.
				 I know that I will find a book quickly and will be enjoying it shortly.
				 The page sells monthly plans for listening to audio books. 
				I have 3 books a month, and I almost always purchase an extra three credits, 
				the site is so easy to use and the accompanying app for playing the books
				 is very consistent and easy to use.</p>

			<h2>Collabedit</h2>
				<p>The collabedit page for free use is very simple. I am drawn to the calming 
				blue header and open space of the unfilled text field used for editing and 
				writing one's program. The site has a nice rounded modern font.
				The style is extremely bare, simple, functional, clear and a bit harsh.
				I love being able to share and edit live with someone without having an account.
				The site is really only functional, it is informative, boring, practical and orderly.
				There are few options, which makes the site easy to use. I just discovered that you
				 can record and view one's session progress, which is a cool feature.
				The site makes me feel kinda ...meh. It is not terribly attractive it has some harshly 
				styled elements. The site doesn't leave much of a footprint which is fine,
				 it's meant to be an invisible tool for doing one's work.
				One can pay for the sit but I haven't subscribed yet, 
				I will probably not go back after using stypi. 
				Collab edit can be slow and a bit buggy at times.</p>

			<h2>Github</h2>
				<p>Github is a fabulous and inviolable tool and resource.
				I am not going to cover all the areas that make it so cool. 
				My eye is definitely drawn to the illustrations and logos of the git octo-cat! 
				The cute little crearure helps to illustrate in 4 large images that link 
				to the main things you want to do at the site: setup git, create repos, 
				fork and share. 
				The look of the site is great. It is modern with nice rounded edges, 
				cute art as I mentioned, contrast of pastel colors and black cats. 
				The site is modern, soft, clean, and subtle.
				The site allows one to track, store, share, and edit files remotely,
				 to keep up with news, and explore others code. 
				There probably many features I am not aware of.
				 I love that I know that no matter what area of the page I am on, 
				I can find clear instructions on how to do whatever I want to do, 
				it is user friendly. For a highly technical site, for use by engineers it puts 
				me at ease and helps me to join the community of productive creators.
				The user can easy toggle back and forth betweeen public and private areas, 
				the main page displays current repos that I am working on, 
				what activity has happened with my projects, a me feed, and links to news,
				 tools to explore others work as well.
				The site makes me feel safe, empowered and creative, even organized!
				The site sells an option to have private repos but I haven't needed one. I would happily pay the subscription just to support the company, as of know I'm a starving student.
