				<h2>Do I like pairing?</h2>
				<li><p>Yes. I didn't think I would.</p></li>
				<li><p>I like sharing ideas.</p></li>
				<li><p>I learn a great deal by seeing other peoples approaches to solving problems</p></li>
				<li><p>I sometimes get unstuck with others help faster than I would on my own...yeah most of the time!</p></li>
				<li><p>I enjoy putting people at ease.</p></li>
				<li><p>I get to practice listening. Sometimes I get to excited and interupt them, or finish their sentences. I also am focusing on listening to every word they say and saying it back in my head, to stop my mind from formulating a response.I'm slowing it down.</p></li>
				<li><p>Sometimes it is difficult to pair remotely, with technical problems interfering with actually writing code.</p></li>
				<li><p>It is more difficult to gage how someone is doing, following along, or feeling long distance.</p></li>
				<li><p>I've learned that most people appreciate my communication style.</p></li>
				<li><p>I am heard and I must remember to let the other person have a say. I've been more proactive by asking the other person what approach they would like to take, drive or navigate and checking in with how they are feeling.</p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				<li><p>When I read positive feedback I feel grateful for this opportunity to participate, learn and facilitate others learning.</p></li>
				<li><p>I feel good about my communication skills.</p></li>
				<li><p>I did get one piece of feedback that surprised me. I was unaware that I was not giving my pair enough say in matters. I feel bad that I was not thoughtful. I have been careful to give my pairs more time to discuss their approach and have had good feed back since then.Sorry pair!!</p></li>
				<li><p>It is sometimes difficult to come up with constructive feed back after a positive pair, in which the other person both communicates well and is more technically skilled than I am.</p></li>
				<li><p>It was most difficult to write feedback when I felt my pair would be embarrassed by what I wrote. But kindness is honesty, and our honest feed back helps us to see what we can improve, which may actually effect our ability to be hired.</p></li>
