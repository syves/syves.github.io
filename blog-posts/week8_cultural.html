			<h1 id="topic">The Heart of conflict</h1> 
			<h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h2>
			<h3>What was the source of the conflict?How did you handle that conflict?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Recently I had a sorta of intervention for a friend. I Strongly suggested that she seek additional help for dealing with long standing emotional issues that effect all areas of her life.</p></li>
				<li><p>My friend decided to sign up for a program and paid only to satisfy me. I didn't realize that she was doing it entirely for my sake. She then choose not to attend and was angry at me for pushing her, and for herself for not choosing for her own sake.</p></li>
				<li><p>I was upset with her for not choosing to work on herself, for not understanding my motivation and for being angry with me. She was angry with me and herself.</p></li>
				<li><p>I took a day to collect my feelings. I spent an hour just listening to her reasons. I refuted all her arguments and excuses for not seeking help. I expressed my love and support for her no matter what. I was strong, and vulnerable, persistent and accepting. I heard her no and allowed her to choose for herself. I continue to inspire her by being different myself. I am loving, supportive, a deep listener and a model of the possibility available having the courage to change.</p></li>

			<h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
				<li><p>I learned that I was not listening deeply. I didn't hear and see her saying no with her body language and energy. I was blinded my vision of achieving my intention, of her saying yes to transformation.</p></li>
				<li><p>I would give her the chance to say yes for herself. I'd let her sleep on. I would give her the chance to make a good decision for herself. I wouldn't have manipulated her by asking her to do it for me.</p></li>
				<li><p>I learned that I can be persistent, that I can influence others, that I can say the difficult things.</p></li>
				<li><p>I learned that even when damage has been done, there is the opportunity for healing if both parties are open hearted and vulnerable, honest and forgiving. We always benefit from being honest.</p></li>
