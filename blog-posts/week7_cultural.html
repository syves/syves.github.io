				<h2>Who wants my help anyway?</h2>
				<li><p>My mother hinted at a situation where she was unsure how to help someone in her community who is struggling with alcoholism</p></li>
				<li><p>She hates confrontations and does not have a very close relationship with this woman.</p></li>
				<li><p>I advised her to talk with another woman who might be closer to get insight into the woman's self awareness.</p></li>
				<li><p>I also supported her in asking in action herself instead of waiting for someone else to take responsibility.</p></li>
				<li><p>I told her that she can't guess what the woman's response will be, but that she should make any effort she can to support her, at least my letting her friend know that others are aware that she is suffering and that she doesn't have to be alone. There are other options for her.</p></li>
